            <p>Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files,
                usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during
                software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
                workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).</p>
